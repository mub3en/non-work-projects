# Form Design Project with Editing Function

This project focuses on designing a form with an editing function. The form includes two tables: Course Information and Speaking Emphasis. Please note that the Speaking Emphasis table is not shown below and needs to be added.

You will be prompted to enter your name and the total number of credits only once. Once your name is entered, the title of both tables will be changed to include your name.

## Course Information

| Course Name | Course Code | Credits |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Math        | MATH101     | 4       |
| English     | ENG201      | 3       |
| Science     | SCI301      | 5       |

## Editing Function

The editing function allows you to edit the details of a specific course. The screen for displaying the editing function can be shown below the table of the course to be edited.

To edit a course, follow these steps:

1. Locate the course in the table.
2. Click on the "Edit" button or select the course row.
3. The editing screen will be displayed below the table.
4. Modify the desired fields (e.g., course name, course code, credits).
5. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.
6. The updated details will be reflected in the table.

Happy editing!
