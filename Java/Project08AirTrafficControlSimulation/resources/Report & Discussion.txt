I ran the code several times and only a few times it will return an output. Poisson distribution makes it interesting as we are gathering a very small dataset out of an infinite or a very large data pool. 

Using Random(System.currentTimeMillis()) with Poisson distribution provides a very low output given the execution time is longer for mili seconds than nano seconds. Instead if we use Random(System.nanoTime()) we get output more frequently with every execution.

I have separated my outputs with behavior variation of the program.

1 - Departure Queue Full
	In this scenario departure queue is always full or no planes are ready to departure. When we look at the statistics, we see total number of departures are zero.

2 - Arrival Queue Full
	In this scenario arrival queue is always full or no planes are arriving. When we look at the statistics, we see total number of arrivals are zero.

3 - Queues Empty
	In this scenario arrival and departure queues are always empty. When we 				look at the statistics, we see total number of arrivals and departures are zero.

4 - Queues Available
	In this scenario we see a nice distribution of departure and arrivals flight. Statistics in this output are interesting to look at.
