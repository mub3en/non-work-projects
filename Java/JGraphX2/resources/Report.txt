I have modeled Government branches with the Government at the root level. 

Government is divided into three branches: Legislative, Executive, Judicial. 

Each branch is further branched into sub categories. 

Legislative branch has Congress which is further divided into 'Senate' and 'House of representatives'.

Executive Branch has 'President' which is further divided into many sub branches but I only mentioned a few. 

Judiciary branch contains Supreme Court and other federal courts.
